# Changelog

All notable changes to these dotfiles (Hyprland, kitty, fish, starship) are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> **Versioning policy** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
> - **MAJOR** — breaking reorganisation (repo restructure, moving to `~/dotfiles` + symlinks, removing/renaming config files others depend on).
> - **MINOR** — new capability: new keybinds, new config module, new script, autostart additions.
> - **PATCH** — tweaks & fixes: value changes, typo/comment fixes, small corrections that don't add features.
>
> **Workflow for every change** (see [README](README.md#maintenance-workflow)):
> 1. Make the config change.
> 2. Bump `VERSION` and add an entry under a new version heading below.
> 3. `git add -A && git commit` with a clear message.
> 4. `git tag vX.Y.Z` and `git push origin main --tags`.

## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-16

Promoted from a hypr-only config into a real dotfiles repo, and added a full terminal stack.

### Changed — BREAKING
- **Repo moved from `~/.config/hypr` to `~/dotfiles`**, with configs symlinked back into `~/.config`.
  Configs now live under `.config/<app>/`; notes moved to `docs/`. All moves used `git mv`, so file
  history is preserved (`git log --follow`).
- `.gitignore` patterns un-anchored so they still match after the move.
- `starship.toml` moved from `~/.config/starship/starship.toml` — a path starship never reads, so it
  had been dormant and doing nothing — to `~/.config/starship.toml`, where it actually loads.
- Starship accents retuned from blue/cyan to the rice pink palette (directory `#f2a1bd`,
  git branch `#c99ade`, git status `#e8a5c0`, time `#958f90`).

### Added
- **kitty config** (`.config/kitty/kitty.conf`) — kitty had no config at all and ran stock defaults.
  CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font 11, rice pink/dark palette (bg `#161013`, fg `#f8dbe4`),
  `background_opacity 0.85` for Hyprland's blur, powerline tabs, split/tab/opacity keybinds,
  and `shell /usr/bin/fish`.
- **fish config** (`.config/fish/config.fish`) — rice-matched syntax colours, eza/bat/git aliases,
  `starship`/`zoxide`/`fzf` init, rice-themed fzf using `fd` as its engine, fish-native OpenClaw
  completions, plus `yy` (yazi cd-on-quit) and `mkcd` helpers.
- Terminal tooling installed: `fish`, `starship`, `zoxide`, `eza`, `bat`, `fd`, `ripgrep`, `yazi`,
  `btop`, `jq`, `chafa`, `tldr`, `neovim`, `luarocks`.
- README: repo layout, symlink re-creation steps, terminal stack table, and a prominent warning
  about the login-shell / boot-chain constraint.

### Removed
- Dead `exec Hyprland` block from `config.fish`. It bypassed the `start-hyprland` watchdog and was
  inert only because fish wasn't installed — installing fish would have made it a live hazard.
- `conf.d/fish_frozen_theme.fish` and `.bak` leftovers — fish 4.3 migration artifacts whose colours
  are now owned by `config.fish`.

### Notes
- **bash remains the login shell, deliberately.** The desktop boots via
  `agetty --autologin nox → bash → ~/.bash_profile → exec start-hyprland`, and fish never reads
  `.bash_profile` — `chsh`-ing to fish would break the boot. Fish is scoped to kitty instead.
- Dormant configs left untouched: `~/.zshrc`, `~/.oh-my-zsh`, `~/.config/zsh/` (zsh isn't the login
  shell, so none of it loads).
- `matugen` is referenced by `hyprlock/colors.conf` but is **not installed**; those colours are a
  static leftover, not dynamically generated.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added
- Autostart KDE Connect daemon (`exec-once = kdeconnectd &`) in `hyprautostart.conf`,
  so phone integration is available on login.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-16

Initial versioned baseline of the Hyprland config.

### Added
- Git repository initialised in `~/.config/hypr`, tracked at `git@github.com:MoKaif/dotfiles.git`.
- `.gitignore` excluding reference rices (`references/`), generated thumbnails, runtime state
  (`scripts/wallpaper-last.txt`), logs, and backups.
- `CHANGELOG.md` + `VERSION` file and a documented Semantic Versioning workflow.
- **Keybinds:** `SUPER + SHIFT + 1..5` to move the focused window to a workspace
  (`movetoworkspace`), complementing the existing `SUPER + 1..5` workspace switches.

### Existing (imported at baseline)
- `hyprland.conf` sourcing `hyprtheme.conf`, `hyprkeys.conf`, `hyprautostart.conf`.
- `hyprkeys.conf` — core keybinds (launchers, focus movement, workspaces, scratchpad, multimedia).
- `hyprtheme.conf` — transparency, blur, dwindle layout, animations.
- `hyprautostart.conf` — waybar, dunst, nm-applet, wallpaper cycle.
- `hyprlock/`, `hyprpaper.conf`, `scripts/wallpaper-cycle.sh`, and supporting docs.
